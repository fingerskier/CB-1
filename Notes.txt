CB/1 - a ColdFusion Builder extension for the FW/1 ColdFusion framework

Author: Matt Currier (fingerskier@gmail.com)

Please feel free to contact me with bugs, suggestions, or other related inquiries regarding this extension.

Future Plans:
	Create a FW/1 project (if possible...)
	Add support for different action default names (and other FW/1 config options)
	Ability to rename sections & items
	Download framework instead of including it with the extension
	add an optional dot-path for the framework.cfc location (create-skeleton)
	
Rainy-Day Plans:
	project tree with ability to add, delete, and RENAME sub-systems, section, items
	testing interface to pull action URLs and introspect rc/view
